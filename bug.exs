```elixir
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Enum.reduce(list, 0, fn x, acc ->
  if x > 3 do
    acc + x
  else
    acc
  end
end)
```
This code has a subtle issue related to the way Elixir handles pattern matching and function clauses.  If the list was empty `Enum.reduce` would return `0` which is expected behaviour.  However, more complex functions might exhibit unexpected behaviour if the list is unexpectedly empty.
